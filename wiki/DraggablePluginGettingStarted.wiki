This plugin is a gwt clone of the [http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ JQuery-ui draggable plugin]

The Draggable plugin allows to enable draggable functionality on any DOM element and GWT widget. 

=Changelog=
==v0.1==
  * First release

=Using the plugin=

==Dependency==

The draggable plugin needs the common-ui library to work. If you are not using maven, just download the [http://code.google.com/p/gwtquery-plugins/downloads/detail?name=commonui-plugin-1.1.jar last version of the library] and put it in the war/WEB-INF/lib folder.

==Configuration==

First of all you have to include the library in the classpath of your project. If you are using ant normally it is enough to download the library from the [http://code.google.com/p/gwtquery-plugins/downloads/list downloads page] and put it in the war/WEB-INF/lib folder. 

If you use maven, you have to add these blocks to your pom.xml
{{{
   <repositories>
        <repository>
         <id>plugins</id>
         <url>http://gwtquery-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/mavenrepo</url>
       </repository>
   </repositories>

   <build>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.googlecode.gwtquery.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>draggable-plugin</artifactId>
            <scope>0.1</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
   </build>
}}}

Then you need to inherit the plugin in your Module.gwt.xml file:
{{{
  <inherits name='gwtquery.plugins.draggable.Draggable'/>
}}}

And finally, as with all gwtQuery plugins, just call the selectable plugin like that :
{{{
import static gwtquery.plugins.draggable.client.Draggable.Draggable;

...

$("#iWantToDrag").as(Draggable).draggable();
}}}

It calls the plugin with the default options. The element who have 'iWantToDrag' as id is now draggable.
