The draggable and droppable plugins of gwtquery allows to make any DOM elements draggable and droppable. In addition, it offers a API in order to add drag and drop support to your GWT widgets included also the new data presentation widgets (aka cell widgets).

This article explains how to use this API in your GWT project.

----
!GwtQuery provides you a bundle including all stuff you need to use gwtquery and its draggable and dropable plugins

First at all, if you don't use maven, you have to download the [https://gwtquery-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/mavenrepo/com/googlecode/gwtquery/bundles/gquery-dnd-bundle/1.0.1/gquery-dnd-bundle-1.0.1.jar gquery-dnd-bundle jar file] and include it in the classpath of you project.

If you use maven, you have to add these blocks to your pom.xml
{{{
   <repositories>
        <repository>
         <id>plugins</id>
         <url>http://gwtquery-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/mavenrepo</url>
       </repository>
   </repositories>

   <build>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.googlecode.gwtquery.bundles</groupId>
            <artifactId>gquery-dnd-bundle</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.1</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
   </build>
}}}

Then you need to inherit the plugin in your Module.gwt.xml file:
{{{
  <inherits name='gwtquery.plugins.droppable.Droppable'/>
}}}
